    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Tell the client to use "https" as its more secure than "http". This is because it uses SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol also confirms that a website server is who it says it is. I would also suggest the client to add an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, okta etc. This ensures that authorization and authentication are hard to crack.   </p>
